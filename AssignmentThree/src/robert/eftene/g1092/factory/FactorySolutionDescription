Bachelor topic title:
    Web application for Online Business Promotion

Description of the problem:
    Towards offering the best experience for our users, we want to allow in the application
    multiple types of users with different roles. These roles are: general user, business owner and administrator.
    In order to optimize the process of creation of these types of users we need a solution that provide us
    a centralized manner of developing based on mandatory fields such as name, email and password.

Advantages:
    - new users can be added that belong to the same family without generating errors
    - it implements the dependency inversion principle
    - increase the control over the creation of the users

Disadvantages:
    - new objects can't be generated
    - the classes cannot be extended
