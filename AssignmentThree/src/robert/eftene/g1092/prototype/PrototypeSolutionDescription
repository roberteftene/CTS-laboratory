Bachelor topic title:
    Web application for Online Business Promotion

Description of the problem:
    The application will allow business owners to get reports regarding the situation of their
    business whenever they want. The statistics will be filtered by the user who will chose
    a certain period of time such as, last week, last month, today, etc. The request for the
    reports can take a lot of time so the application will develop a solution that will increase
    the performance by cloning a certain report and filtering the clones after that by period.

Advantages:
    - no constructor call needed
    - request are handled much performant

Disadvantages:
    - risk of generating shallow copies
