Code review

1. Code structure & naming conventions

- the package name is too generic;
- the class name is saying nothing;
- the function name is too generic;
- the function arguments names are not ok;

2. Implementation
- too many "magic numbers" (hardcoded value)
- is t limited to {1, 2, 3, 4} or it can be bigger?
- there are no validations for t, s and perioada

3. Single responsability & KISS
- outsource the intermediary operations into new simple functions
